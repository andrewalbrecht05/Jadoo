Last Wednesday, I visited my granparent's house. I've stayed there longer than usual, so I was returning home very late.
You can say, that I could stay for one night and go home next morning, but actually i couldnt, because my friend 
was tooking part in a football championship so i want to root for him.
It was a big trouble to return, because the streets werent illuminated. This problem is the root cause of crime and it has its roots
in bad communation between utility companies with local authorities. I think we must get to the root of the problem as
soon as possible and root it out for good. The problem of light can't take root, because it won't be safe place for kids and adults 
as well.
